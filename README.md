# PowerBI
Getting started on with the dynamically evolving Power BI and Business Intelligence!

### Note
I am not following any certain book or courses to get started with PowerBI. I am also not going to dive into big projects, untill I explore and study about the various aspects of Power BI tools. What I will be doing here is taking on different datasets and exploring the features of PowerBI through them.

### Dataset

- The data that I will be using for my first lesson in PowerBI is tha Global PowerPlant Database from kaggle, which you can find in here:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eshaan90/global-power-plant-database?select=global_power_plant_database.csv
- The dataset consists of lot of columns; I am going to use only few of them for my first analysis. Hence I duplicated the excel sheet into another new sheet, did few modifications in Excel and then going to get started on the analysis.
